## 🔄 Workflow Implementation

### Complete Task Lifecycle

```
PM Creates Task → TL Assigns to TM → TM Works → TM Submits → 
TL Reviews → (Approve → Senior Reviews → Approve → COMPLETE)
           ↓                            ↓
        Reject                        Reject
           ↓                            ↓
       Back to TM ←──────────────────────┘
```

### Approval Logic
- **Level 1**: Team Leader approval required
- **Level 2**: Senior approval required (after TL approval)
- **Rejection**: Mandatory comments, returns to Team Member
- **Rework**: Team Member can resubmit after corrections
